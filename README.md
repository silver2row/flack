RE: L298 Motor Driver from Open-Electronics.org and the BeagleBone Black/Python...

The board can be found here: https://store.open-electronics.org/robotics/electronics/L298DRIVER.

The BBB, BeagleBone Black, can be found here: https://beagleboard.org/.
The BBB and other variations can be found online and w/ an easy google search.

I have some basic software, some leads, and the connections are made from the BBB to the L298 motor driver.
I am using Adafruit_BBIO which can be found here: https://github.com/adafruit/adafruit-beaglebone-io-python.

Python 2.7.x is what I am using to type up the software.
